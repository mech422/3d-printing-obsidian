Shake&Tune is a [[Klipper]] plugin from the [Klippain](https://github.com/Frix-x/klippain) ecosystem, designed to create insightful visualizations to help you troubleshoot your mechanical problems and give you tools to better calibrate the input shaper filters on your 3D printer. It can be installed on any [[Klipper]] machine and is not limited to those using the full Klippain.

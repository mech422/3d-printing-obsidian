Contained In: git 

The purpose of (yet another) fork of the Viesturz/klipper-toolchanger repo is to attempt to simplify the installation for StealthChanger users. This repo combines the configuration, macros, and Python into a single repo. It also outlines patterns for overriding configuration to ease installation and allow easier updates.

Requires [[Klipper]]

All of the documentation for StealthChanger still applies and should be what you're following (except the Installation portion) [https://github.com/DraftShift/StealthChanger/wiki](https://github.com/DraftShift/StealthChanger/wiki)

**This assumes you have a WORKING PRINTER and configuration**

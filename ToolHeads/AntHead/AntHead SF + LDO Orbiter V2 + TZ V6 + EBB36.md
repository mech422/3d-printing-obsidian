To build an Anthead for the above you'll probably want the following parts:
  [[AntHead]]
  [[N3MI-AntHead_Mods]] (for LEDs)
  [[LED Solder Fixture]] Averen's LED jig
 Recommended:  [[PCB36 - EBB36 Backplates and ToolBoard Mounts]] TheSins- backplate / Mount
Alternative: [[orbiter-v2-ebb-carrier]]

Use the SF Ducts and body
TheSins [[PCB36 - EBB36 Backplates and ToolBoard Mounts]] are recommended for backplate/mounts
as an alternative you can use the stock Stealthchanger backplate and onsimon's board mount
[[N3MI-AntHead_Mods]] are highly recommended for nozzle LEDs and Averen's LED jib makes them easier to solder

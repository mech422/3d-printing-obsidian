Contained In: git

This umbilical system is ultimately made up of 2 components. The "Umbilical Plate" which mounts to the rear panel of your Voron V2 or Micron printer and the "Umbilical Restraints" that help tame the umbilical on its way to the tool head. There are various combinations on how these components can be configured, choose wisely.

Works with [[Voron-2.4]]  [[Micron]]

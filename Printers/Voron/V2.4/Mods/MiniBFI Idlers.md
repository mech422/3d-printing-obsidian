## MiniBFI and MicroBFI

This is a miniature version of the BFI which does not extend into the front extrusions allowing for a crossbar to be mounted to a stock Voron frame ( [[Voron-2.4]] [[Micron]] etc. ).

Fully based on and credits go to [BFI](https://github.com/clee/VoronBFI) By Clee + Hartk.

You can follow the [BFI manual](https://github.com/clee/VoronBFI/blob/main/docs/Assembly_Manual_BFI.pdf). The assembly process is very similar.

It's recommended to use the [Belt Helper](https://github.com/DraftShift/StealthChanger/tree/main/STLs/Extras/BeltHelper) to install the belt since there is not much travel.
